If you have lines of code in your program that have a portion such as: "/"/TODO: Fix this part" and want to keep track of these, this is your tool!

Searches through all current files and subfolders for these lines, and creates an issue in the respective Github repo automatically. 

Simply run the tool (python autoissue.py) and it'll do all of the work for you, after prompting you for your Github Credentials (which will request a token that will be saved, so you shouldn't have to enter your info more than once).

Feel free to submit pull requests/issues/contact us/etc.
